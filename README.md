# dottxt

Information for extremely low bandwidth environments.

## Guide

Visit [dottxt.link](http://dottxt.link) for a list of valid urls and functionality. SSL is supported but not required.

## Limitations

dottxt is hosted with Cloudflare Workers. While there is no limitation on how long your client / browser can take to load a page, Cloudflare does, "updates the Workers runtime a few times per week." During this time there is a 30 second grace period before the worker is terminated. It is unlikely for you to run into a situation where it takes longer than 30 seconds to load a page, and Cloudflare happens to deploy an update at the same time.

Cloudflare always responds with certain headers, which are not necessary for functionality. This brings the total size of response headers to ~520 bytes uncompressed. With compression, the current size of the landing page sits around 600B - 650B.
